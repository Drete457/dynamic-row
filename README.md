Dynamic Row 

represents the solution to maintain social distances between students, 
teachers and staff within universities, during the Coronavirus Emergency 

Inspiration

All professors and university staff fear the reopening of universities, but understand that remote learning does not have the same value as that given in classrooms and for which students pay and the state has spent a lot of time and money. Some activities cannot be carried out remotely, such as profit exams, traineeships and laboratory activities. These are carried out by students, PhD students and post-docs within the departments of the universities. Little by little we must go back to the normal life, and if we can't go back immediately (June-July) surely in the near future we will have to find a solution to keep our distance and avoid the crowds outside the single departments.

What it does

The solution we offer is a system capable of creating a virtual row to manage the profit exams, the frequency of traineeships and research laboratories at university locations. Apart from the list of students generated by the web portals, there are currently no systems capable of guaranteeing social distancing. This system should create virtual classrooms and laboratories, within which a certain number of people will be inserted by the app. At the same time the app will create a virtual row for people who have to enter the classroom, dynamic row because the order of entry will be determined by the distance of the student from the location of the classroom. In the case of research laboratories, and in particular in the case of laboratories dedicated to particular techniques such as cell culture rooms, the laboratory manager will create a virtual laboratory in which he will decide how many operators can enter and when, leaving outside who wait to enter to carry out his experiments. A dynamic management of the queue avoids an enormous waste of time for teachers, students and operators and queue forming outside the Department or the classrooms. A pre-ordered distribution of students with pre-established intervals represents a huge waste of time, because an exam can last from 5 minutes to 45 minutes and it would therefore be difficult to establish a suitable time interval beforehand to receive the students. On the other hand, very long intervals would lead to dividing the exams in very long times. This app will be useful not only during Covid-19 Emergency, but will be very useful to manage the university life also in the future. Optimization of the system will be useful also for public offices and congresses.
